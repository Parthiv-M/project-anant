const SpinPolarisedBand = "The FM ordered spin polarized electronic band structure shows that in the absence of SOC effect, the two nodal points along the Γ−K and Γ−K′ paths are at the same energy level";

const SOCBand = "A nontrivial gap opens up at the nodal points due to the SOC effect. As a result of the breaking of inversion symmetry in this non-centrosymmetric MXene monolayer,  the degeneracies of two valleys get lifted with a valley splitting along Γ−K and Γ−K′ in the valence and conduction band after the inclusion of SOC";

const BerryCurvature = "Sharp and dissimilar negative BC peaks have been observed due to the valleys along Γ−K and Γ−K′, implying valley-dependent polarization. Additionally, the integral of the BC over the full Brillouin zone is nonzero, leading to the Chern number (C) of 1";

const SurfaceState = "Single chiral edge state connecting the valence band to the conduction band within the bulk band gap confirms the presence of a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state in this MXene monolayer";

const ElectronicBandStructure = "Semiconductors are the main candidates for thermoelectric materials. With the help of electronic band structures, we can identify whether the material is semiconducting or not"

const ELF = "ELF measures the probability of finding a second electron in the vicinity of one reference electron. The values assigned to ELF are in the range of 0–1, where one corresponds to perfect localization (covalent bonding) and zero corresponds to complete delocalization (no bonding)";

const PhononDispersionCurve = "The dynamical stability of the materials is investigated by calculating the phonon frequencies along high symmetry directions. Absence of imaginary phonon frequencies in the phonon dispersions confirms the dynamical stability of the given material";

const GrunesianParam = "It is the measure of anharmonicity present in the system, which has an inverse relationship with lattice thermal conductivity (κl)∝1/γ^2. This indicates that higher γ would lead to a lower κl";

const GroupVelocity = "Phonon group velocity is the velocity at which they propagate inside the material. For high performing thermoelectrics, materials with low phonon group velocity are preferred";

const RelaxationTime = "Accurate calculation of relaxation time (τ) is required for precise prediction of figure of merit (ZT). Different electron–phonon scattering has a vital role in determining τ. Among these, the scattering of electrons with acoustic and optical phonons is the most effective in a thermoelectric module. Deformation potential theory has been used to calculate τ here";

const FigureOfMerit = "The performance of thermoelectric materials is measured by calculating thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT)";
